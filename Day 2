Question 1
———–––——–—–

A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements unlike string and tuple. 
Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. 
Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ] .

Functions: 1) We can access a range of items in a list by using the slicing operator :(colon).
           2) We can use the assignment operator (=) to change an item or a range of items.
           3) We can add one item to a list using the append() method or add several items using extend() method.
              We can also use + operator to combine two lists. This is also called concatenation.
              The * operator repeats a list for the given number of times.
              Furthermore, we can insert one item at a desired location by using the method insert() or insert multiple items 
              
by squeezing it into an empty slice of a list.
           4) We can delete one or more items from a list using the keyword del. It can even delete the list entirely.
              We can use remove() method to remove the given item or pop() method to remove an item at the given index.
              The pop() method removes and returns the last item if the index is not provided. This helps us implement lists as stacks (first in, last out data structure).
              

We can also use the clear() method to emp

ty a list.
